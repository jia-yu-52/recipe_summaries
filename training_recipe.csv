Chicken Piccata ,"Great recipe! One tip I’ve found really helpful when cooking chicken is using a timer to ensure it’s perfectly cooked—especially when multitasking in the kitchen. I often rely on an online timer at www.5mintimer.com while roasting or grilling to avoid overcooking. It’s simple, quick, and keeps me on track. Thanks again for the fantastic guide!",0.5,0.5,0.5,1

Chicken Piccata ,This was great! I did what the other person suggested - I put this over plain linguini and it was perfect. Served with a side of roasted asparagus as well! This would be a great simple meal to serve guests - it looks beautiful. Will make again.,1,0.5,1,1
Chicken Piccata ,"I made it exactly as written, except for cutting the recipe in half since there were just two of us. It was absolutely wonderful, served with fresh linguine and asparagus. The only thing I will change is to go lightly with the salt on the chicken before flouring it. The sauce has plenty of salt so just a pinch on each side will be enough. This is definitely going on the rotation for weeknight dinners. ",0.5,1,1,1

Chicken Piccata ,"This recipe is on our monthly rotation, a definite family favorite meal. It’s easy to make and always turns out great. I don’t put the chicken back into the sauce but serve it on buttered and parselyed tagliatelle and pour the sauce over. It makes a beautiful presentation and is fancy enough for company. ",1,0.5,1,1

Easy pasta salad,"Just so dang delicious! Perfect to make during our hot summer days. The spicy tang from the peppers is a nice surprise. Not heavy at all, no mayo and easy to add lots of extra crunch veggies if one wants more veggies.",0.5,1,1,1
Easy pasta salad,Very good recipe. Enjoyed.,0.5,0.5,0.5,1
Easy pasta salad,This is an excellent recipe that would appeal to many at a potluck or cookout. The veggies can be changed out for ones you have on hand like diced cucumber is especially good for crunch. The dressing is outstanding and vibrant and fresh with the lemon zest and juice. I used just 2 T grated parmigiana which was plenty. I used mild banana peppers. I also used mini pearls of mozzarella which was quick and easy. This recipe is wonderful and tasty. The dressing is exactly what you want it to be.,1,1,1,1
Easy pasta salad,"This pasta salad is delicious! It is light and refreshing. I did cut the recipe in half as I wanted to test it before I serve it at a BBQ. Even half made a ton of salad. I made the recipe verbatim, except added a tiny bit more EVOO, used only yellow squash and herbs from my garden. My only regret is I bought mild pickled banana peppers. Next time I will get the hot peppers. Do not hesitate to serve this at your picnics. It is wonderful!",0.5,1,1,1

Slow Cooker BBQ Pulled Pork,"I tried this recipe for the first time and unfortunately, I was very disappointed. The rub sounds like a great idea, but when I went to pan sear the pork, the seasoning just fell off in the pan and burned. The amount of liquid that it says to put back in after you shred the pork is too much! I had to drain some of it off. Then finally, I was not impressed with the flavour. My son went to culinary school, so he was able to salvage the pork by adding vinegar, soy sauce, fish sauce and other items in quantities that I don't know. I will NOT make this again! I have previously cooked pork butt in a slow cooker by seasosning it with salt and pepper and onion. I shread the pork and then add the bbq sauce that I like. That way comes out so much better and is easier than this recipe. This is the first recipe on Epicurious that I did NOT like!",0.5,0,0,0

Sticky-Sweet Grilled Pork Shoulder with Hoisin and Molasses,The sauces could have been replaced by five spice powder. Took me a lot of time to assemble all the ingredients. But worth it nonetheless.,1,0.5,1,1
Fish Curry,"great flavour, easy to make. Not overly spicy but loads of flavour.",1,1,0.5,1
Fish Curry,"This is fantastic! I made some subs as I did not have all the ingredients. No mustard seeds. No curry leaves or the other optional ingredient. Instead I used whole grain mustard and a bit of curry powder. I also used a can of the Rotel tomatoes with mild chiles instead of just plain crushed tomatoes. The first time I made this I used tilapia. Fabulous! Second time making it I added a red and green pepper, a little bit of leftover tilapia and shrimp. Served it over brown rice. Heavenly! This is now in the regular rotation of recipes for us. We had enough for two meals both times for the two of us and we were craving those leftovers it was so darn good!",0.5,1,1,1
Fish Curry,Made this with humble pollock and It was great. Served with raita and some naan. Really couldn't improve on the dish although I want to try it with nicer fish like mahi mahi or similar. Overall it was wonderful.,0.5,0.5,1,1
Sri Lankan-Style Black Pork Curry,High effort but so worth it. I personally love a vinegary curry and this didn't disappoint. Would make again.,1,1,0.5,1
Sri Lankan-Style Black Pork Curry,"Not a good curry IMO, the vinegar is odd and gives it a sour taste. Might be okay recommend making with no vinegar",0.5,0,0.5,0
Curried shrimp with cucumber vinaigrette,"I really wanted to like this recipe more than I did, but I was disappointed. I took it on a picnic and the shrimp was really cold -- I really didn't like the texture as a result, and I just couldn't get over that. I loved the cucumber vinaigrette, but I just can't give the dish a thumbs up.",0.5,0,0.5,0

spiced sweet potato gratin,"this recipe was not difficult, although I peeled the sweet potatoes first and then boiled them. It just wasn't that good. It was not bad and my mother liked them a lot but no one else at the table was crazy about them. It wasn't an embarrassment but I wouldn't make it again.",0.75,0.25,0.5,0.25
cool curry cauliflower soup,"I made this as written as it was OK. If I did make it again, I would leave out the tomato. One tomato did not add any flavour and turned the soup sort of a yuccky pink colour.",0.5,0.5,0.5,0.25
vietnamese beef noodles,"this recipe is not even close to Pho. Snow Peas? Not only that, star anise is a large part of the recipe and it is not listed at all. I would not recommend this recipe to anyone. I am equally appauled.",0.5,0,0.5,0

tahini cookies,"flavourless and horrible texture. My 14 year put it best, ""Mom, I feel like I just ate sand."" She did not mean it like delightful sandie cookies. Sad they all got dumped in the trash :(. My other daughter asked me to put this on the never ever ever make again list.",0.5,0,0.5,0

melon and mango with pork,"I've cooked at least fifty recipes from this site, maybe 100, and this is the first where I threw away the food without serving it. The pork should be cut in THIN strips, not long stirps. Long strips, even moderately thin long strips, end up not cooking all the way through. the citrus really didn't work, giving it a sour taste. very unrecommended.",0.5,0,0.5,0
curried macaroni crisps,"sorry to say that I must agree with other reviewer. Too greasy, not terribly tasty.",0.5,0,0.5,0
